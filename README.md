# Research Data Repository

This repository contains supplementary files for the research study "On the Usability of mHealth Stroke Apps."

## Contents

- **Results from MARS Evaluation**: Raw results from the three evaluators in the MARS evaluation.
- **Accessibility Evaluation**: Raw results from the Accessibility evaluation where the Google Accessibility Scanner was used.
- **Readability Evaluation**: Raw results from readability assessments.
